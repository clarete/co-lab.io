        Masaryk Co-Lab creates processes to make community work more
        effective through leveraging digital technology.  We don't
        have a permanent office space or address. We go where
        technology can be helpful for people that are getting their
        hands dirty and working with community. Currently we're
        partnering with Masaryk Towers, a housing community in the
        Lower East Side, to develop a model of tech based community
        work, including a computer lab and health management tools.
